=================
HOW PROGRAM WORKS:
=================
->The first thing our program does is ask user for some inputs like the time they have to watch, rating they gave to the last show/movie and the genre they want to watch. 
->According to these user input values, the program creates a playlist of shows/movies that it suggests the users to watch. The source of these shows/movies is FavoriteTVShowMovies.txt file.
->A show/movie is suggested if its duration is less than or equal to the time user has and if the rating of the show/movie is greater than or equal to the rating user gave to the last show/movie and the movie/show is of same genre as user input genre.
->If user inputs "Drama" as their genre and if a movie/show has genre "Mystery/Drama", that movie/show is included in the user's playlist.
->This playlist is then displayed (only the names) to the user and they are asked for the name of the show/movie they want the details of. 
->Once the user inputs the name of the show/movie from the diplayed list, they are given the details of that show/movie. The details include title, genre, duration, user rating, rating and year of release.

==================
EXCEPTIONS HANDLED:
===================
1) If a user enters empty value in any fields, it throws an exception stating that at least one of the entered values was empty and the program asks for user input again.
2) If the user enters values other than numbers in time and rating fields, it throws an invalid arguments exception and the program asks for input again.
3) User has the option to input genre in any of lower or upper case string.
4) After the user has been displayed the playlist tailored to him/her, they can ask for details about a show/movie. If they input the name that is not in the list, it means that the item is not in their playlist. So they will be displayed a message conveying that the item is not in the list.
